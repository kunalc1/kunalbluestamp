# Project Name/Title Goes Here
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was using my Arduino UNO to change the brightness of a LED light when there was less light. To achieve this, I used a photoresistor and some math to change the LED brightness. One problem that I had was that the photoresistor wasn't reading correctly, and I wasn't able to use it to change the LED. This milestone important because being able to change a value slightly depending on the light will be useful when moving the solar panel in the final design.
