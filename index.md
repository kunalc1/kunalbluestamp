# Final Milestone
My final milestone was finalizing the design. I included the solar panel and built the frame out of wood. My modification was the LCD screen which displays how much light went to each photoresistor. Some issues that I had were that I didn't have access to spring steel, so the motor wasn't able to move the solar panel without it. I substituted this part with a pipe cleaner, which is a cheaper and more available alternative. I also had trouble building the wooden frame, but I persevered and got it done in the end.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is that a servo motor will turn in the direction of the light. For this to work, I used the same photoresistors, but I also connected a servo motor to the Arduino which could take data through the analog pins. One issue that I had was that the motor wasn't turning even when I put light. To fix this, I changed when the motor would move to be more sensitive. This will be used in my final design to move the solar panel.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was using my Arduino UNO to change the brightness of a LED light when there was less light. To achieve this, I used a photoresistor and some math to change the LED brightness. One problem that I had was that the photoresistor wasn't reading correctly, and I wasn't able to use it to change the LED. This milestone important because being able to change a value slightly depending on the light will be useful when moving the solar panel in the final design.
